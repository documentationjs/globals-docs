# 2.3.0

* feat(types): Add TypedArray TypedArray is not exactly an available global property or constructor
    but it is used to talk about typed array constructors in general.
    It is documented as a global in MDN and it would be useful to have it
    linked when an API accepts any typed array argument.<Paste>

# 2.1.0

* Added deep-links for node.js event & stream APIs
